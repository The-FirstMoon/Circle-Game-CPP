# Circle Guessing Game ðŸŽ®

This is my **first ever C++ project**.  
It's a simple console game where you guess whether the circle will be **empty (0)** or **full (1)**.  

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter `1` to play or `0` to quit.
3. Guess whether the circle will be empty (0) or full (1).
4. The program draws the circle and tells you if you guessed right.

## Features
- Random circle generation (empty or full)
- Points & score tracking
- Console colors (Windows only)
- Fun ASCII-art circles

## How to Run
Clone the repo and compile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/circle-game.git
cd circle-game
g++ main.cpp -o circlegame
./circlegame
